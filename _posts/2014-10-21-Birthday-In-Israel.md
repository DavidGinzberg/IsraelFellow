title: Happy Birthday To Me
---

Today was the last day before the Fellowship officially starts. It was also my birthday. I didn't do much about that, but I did go with two of my roommates to set up our bank accounts, and our fourth roommate arrived today as well. Now almost everyone is here and the real fun can begin tomorrow!

Actually setting up the bank accounts took about three hours, and there was some confusion regarding what type of account to create, but it was otherwise a very easy process and one of the last 'overhead' tasks I needed to take care of before the program begins.

The next few days are our orientation, which will probably be very busy, but I expect we'll be settling into our normal rhythm for the first few months as early as this Sunday (which is a normal weekday in Israel).
