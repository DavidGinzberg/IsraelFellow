First post! I suppose it's only appropriate to talk about how I got here.

I've been preparing for this journey for months, since I got the good news in late May of this year.

The last few weeks have been a hectic rush to prepare everything: Sort out subscriptions and memberships; get tickets and visas; pack everything; weigh the bag; repack *almost* everything.

Finally this morning it was time to leave. I was up a bit late last night packing, but not nearly late as I would have been without Amanda's help. We had time for a little breakfast and then it was hugs and kisses and off to the airport. This is an important day so naturally it was a good time for my stomach to demonstrate its impeccable impression of a toddler going through the 'terrible twos'... (I really wish I could have used [sarcastises](http://i.imgur.com/EqpgHp3.jpg) here.)

We arrived at the airport and after a few more hugs and goodbyes I was on my way to the check-in counter. After checking my bag and making it through security in record time I began to relax and enjoy the moment. Eventually I boarded my flight to Toronto, and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that I had the entire row to myself.

The flight was comfortable and once I arrived in Toronto I rested for a bit, charged my electronics, and had a late lunch. Eventually it came time to board the long-haul flight. As is typical for flights to Israel, there was a secondary security check at the gate, and the line extended nearly half the length of the international terminal at YYZ! After some time waiting in line, I boarded soon-to-be full Boeng 787 alongside two newly-initiated harpists traveling to Jerusalum for a convention. (yes-they have harpist conventions. no- I didn't know that either)

After *gingerly* placing my backpack and jacket respectively next to and on one of the harps and settling into my seat we began rolling down the runway and...

You'll just have to read tomorrow's post to find out since it was an overnight flight! [:shit:](http://hyperallergic.com/67327/i-have-a-question-about-emoji/)
