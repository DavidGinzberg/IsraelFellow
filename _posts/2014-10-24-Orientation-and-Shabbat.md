title: Orientation and Shabbat
---

The past few days have been a great start to the program. We officially began on the afternoon of Wednesday, October 22.

After some brief snacks in a small conference room where we checked in and met the other fellows, we watched a few presentations about the program which included rules, introductions, a calendar overview, and a brief recap of the motivation behind the program. Once all of this was finished, we set out for [Masada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada) via [Highway 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_1_(Israel))

Since many of us had only just met and had not spoken for more than a minute or two, this was a rather loud ride with many conversations throughout the bus. Along the route we passed by Jerusalem, and then briefly drove through the West Bank, a place I either have never ridden through or was unaware of riding through on previous trips. With all the conversations I personally don't know how long we rode, but I suspect it was around three hours including traffic. In the end, as we came close to Masada we learned that we would have to rush in to the dining hall, as it was set to close in just half an hour.

...More to come after I get some sleep :sleepy:
