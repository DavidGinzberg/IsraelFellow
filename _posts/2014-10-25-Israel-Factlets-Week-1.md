title: Israel Factlets Week 1
---

Part of living in a new place is learning about that place. To that end, every weekend I will add a post with one or more facts about Tel Aviv or Israel.

Here's today's fact: Tel Aviv's mayor is [Ron Huldai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Huldai), a member of the [Labor Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Labor_Party) originally elected to office in 1998. He is the seventh person to hold this office and was most recently reelected in 2008.

That's it for today. These posts will be particularly short since they are really only meant as factlets (not [factoids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoid)). Eventually I might add a new page layout to reflect this different type of post.
