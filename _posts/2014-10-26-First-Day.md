title: First Day
---

Today was our first day of Tech Challenge Fellows content. To be clear, it wasn't the first day of the program, which was orientation last week, or the first day of learning, which is Tuesday.

Today's focus was on familiarizing ourselves with the startups in Tel Aviv, and with the history and culture of the area and how those tie into the startup mentality here. It was a day of learning and enlightenment, as well as a bit of repetition of old themes from previous visits to Israel (but with a healthy dose of new content!)

We started the day in [Neve Tzedek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neve_Tzedek), the first modern Jewish neighborhood in Tel Aviv, where we learned about the history of Tel Aviv from the 1800s to the mid 20th century. After this we heard from representatives of [Startup Nation Central](http://www.startupnationcentral.org/) and had lunch at their office. We learned about where the future lies for startups, both in Israel and globally, and how the folks at Startup Nation Central are working toward that future, and had a very in-depth discussion about cultural differences, as well as what to expect from Israelis in life and the workplace and how to handle working with them as compared to the cultures we are used to in our home countries.

Finally, we took a long walk along the Tel Aviv coastline before heading to a unique dinner: A cooking class at [Foodsteps](http://www.foodsteps.co.il/inner.aspx?pid=220) where we cooked our own food before eating it (way too much of it!)

In the end it was an exhausting, exhilirating, and very enjoyable first day. And with that, I think it's time to hit the hay! [:zzz:](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379)
