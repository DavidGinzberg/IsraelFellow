Wow, where has the time gone? It's been nearly three weeks since my last post!

After we finished our first few days of introduction, we dove right into some pretty heavy topics. We spent two days covering statistics and probability, going over about a semester's worth of content each day, and we've had similarly paced lessons in networking, linear algebra, python, C, server infrastructure, and a number of other topics.

But it hasn't been all work and no play. In the evenings and weekends, many of us have gone out to parties, swing and salsa dancing, hiking, or to visit friends and family. We have also had a few group Shabbat dinners and other activities that were great chances to relax and get to know each other a little better.

Throughout all of this the folks at ITC have been very hepful, and have been giving us plenty of opportunities to give feedback on the pace and content of the lessons and activities. This feedback takes multiple forms, including online forms and in-person discussions about what works and what doesn't.

And let's not forget the break-out sessions. Over the last few weeks, when part of a lecture didn't make sense or was hard to follow, or when people just wanted to dive deeper, review, or work on side projects, we've gathered as small groups to work independently outside of class.

Overall this program is only just starting, but already we've started to learn some awesome things and I see a lot of potential for what we could learn and achieve in the next nine months. I just can't wait to be able to have a conversation completely in Hebrew...which should be easier after I've had more than just three [Hebrew Ulpan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulpan) classes.

And now with this post done and Shabbat over, it's time to grab a bite with friends at the mall! [:fork_and_knife:](http://www.israel-food-guide.com/israeli-food.php)
