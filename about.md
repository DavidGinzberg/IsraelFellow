This blog is all about my experiences in Israel as a participant in the Israel Tech Challenge Fellows program.

###The Program

Israel Tech Challenge Fellows is a new ten-month program organized by [Israel Tech Challenge](https://israeltechallenge.com/) and subsidized by [Masa Israel](http://www.masaisrael.org/). It is technology-focused and an amazing opportunity for young Jewish professionals from around the world.

### Who Am I?

At least for now, I expect anyone looking at this page already knows who I am, but here are the basics: I studied Computer Science in college, finished my undergraduate degree in 2012, and spent two years living and working in Chicago as a software engineer before running off to Israel to join this program.

### Contact me

For now this blog is targeted at people who already know me and how to reach me, so I won't be including any additional contact info here. However it is worthwhile to note that despite being in Israel during this program, I can still send and receive calls and texts with my US number (more about that in a post...later).
