## What we know about big data
 - 4 'v's: variety, volume, velocity, value
 - It's **BIG**
 -- 2.5 Petabytes generated daily
 - It's a buzz word (in 2012 anyway)
 - it's messy
 - It's unused
 -- Only 23% estimated as valuable
 -- but only 3% is actually tagged and .5% analyzed
 - but people say it's useful (See gartner magnitude index -- [here?](http://www.collaborative.com/blog/useful-models-for-indexing-big-datas-impact/))
 - How does it all make sense? *analyze it*
 
   Enaling big data is becoming central to enterprise strategy  
   Every member of the C-suite has an interest in a company's big data strategy.  
   Most companies have an opportunity to utilize big data to improve their strategy.

# Getting Started

## Making Sense out of data is not always Trivial

Example: Warplanes with a low survival rate. Some come back riddled with bullets, others don't come back
Where do you reinforce them?
**Answer:** Where there aren't bullet holes -- those are the fatal points on the plane when shot.

###Big Data In Action

Make better Decisions using Big Data

- Acquire, Organize, Decide, Analyze
  - Acquire all available data
  - Organize and distill big data using massie parallelism
  - Analyze all your data at once
  - Decide based on real-time Big Data
- We'll focus on Decision and Analysis
