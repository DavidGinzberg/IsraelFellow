* End to end business solutions

## What we know about big data
 - 4 'v's: variety, volume, velocity, value
 - It's **BIG**
 -- 2.5 Petabytes generated daily
 - It's a buzz word (in 2012 anyway)
 - it's messy
 - It's unused
 -- Only 23% estimated as valuable
 -- but only 3% is actually tagged and .5% analyzed
 - but people say it's useful (See gartner magnitude index -- [here?](http://www.collaborative.com/blog/useful-models-for-indexing-big-datas-impact/))
 - How does it all make sense? *analyze it*
 
   Enaling big data is becoming central to enterprise strategy  
   Every member of the C-suite has an interest in a company's big data strategy.  
   Most companies have an opportunity to utilize big data to improve their strategy.
####Key Verticals -- Industries embracing Big Data

# Getting Started

## Making Sense out of data is not always Trivial

Example: Warplanes with a low survival rate. Some come back riddled with bullets, others don't come back
Where do you reinforce them?
**Answer:** Where there aren't bullet holes -- those are the fatal points on the plane when shot.

###Big Data In Action

Make better Decisions using Big Data

- Acquire, Organize, Decide, Analyze
  - Acquire all available data
  - Organize and distill big data using massie parallelism
  - Analyze all your data at once
  - Decide based on real-time Big Data
- We'll focus on Decision and Analysis

### The birth of a new role: Data Scientist

[Data science definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)  
Gartner (March 2012)
 - Data Management
   - Understand data
 - Analytics modeling
   - Know analytics
 - Business analysis
   - Focus on the business
     -Goals
     - Constraints
     - Decisions
     - Communication of results

Data scientist categories
- Programming skills

####Why is Data Science different from "Old" statistics/data mining/machine learning?

- Type of Data
  - Before: structured
  - Today: Structured& unstructured
-Availability
  - Before: No data available, every research new collection
  - Today: Data already collected; available for analysis
- Volume
  - Before: Existing tools were able to process small samples
  - Today Good processing capabilities for terabytes of data
- Productization
  - Before: Analysis mainly for research purposes
  - Today: Ongoing decision making  based on analytics components
